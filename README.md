# Privacy Biometric Authentication System

A cutting-edge biometric authentication system built on blockchain technology, utilizing Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to ensure complete privacy and security of biometric data.

## Project Overview

This system revolutionizes biometric authentication by encrypting biometric templates directly on the blockchain, ensuring that sensitive biometric data never exists in plaintext form. Users can register, verify, and manage their biometric credentials with complete privacy guarantees.

## Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
The system leverages Zama's FHE implementation to enable computations on encrypted biometric data without ever decrypting it. This ensures:
- **Zero-knowledge verification**: Biometric matching occurs without revealing actual biometric patterns
- **Computational privacy**: All biometric operations maintain encryption throughout the process
- **Provable security**: Mathematical guarantees that biometric data remains private

### Confidential Biometric Features
The platform supports multi-modal biometric authentication:
- **Fingerprint Recognition**: Encrypted fingerprint hash storage and matching
- **Facial Recognition**: Secure face template processing with FHE protection
- **Voice Authentication**: Encrypted voice print analysis and verification
- **Iris Recognition**: Confidential iris pattern storage and comparison

Each biometric modality is processed independently and combined for enhanced security through multi-factor biometric verification.

The PrivacyBiometric contract implements comprehensive biometric management:

### Key Features
- **Multi-Modal Registration**: Supports simultaneous registration of multiple biometric types
- **Encrypted Storage**: All biometric templates stored as encrypted data using Zama FHE
- **Verification Scoring**: Advanced scoring system that evaluates biometric matches across all modalities
- **Access Control**: Role-based authorization for administrative functions
